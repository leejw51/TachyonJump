Opensource Deep Learning Search Engine

## How it work
Teach AI using user's keywords and website.

## Why it should be open technology
AI technology is good stuff, but it should be used in right places.

## Database Algorithm
* Make words to vector
* Use RNN for each word vector
* Label is "URL Address"
* Neural Network is very large, I mean above TB

## Search Algorthm
* User enters keyword
* It goes to RNN
* It outputs final URL tensor


## How can it be better than Google?
If AI is trained well and continuously, it will be smarter in searching what user needs.

## To Solve many computers
* Build distributed system to make a huge Database


## How AI Works
Deep learning make neural network for understanding tensor.
Then it will much smarter than current score-based Google algorithm.
